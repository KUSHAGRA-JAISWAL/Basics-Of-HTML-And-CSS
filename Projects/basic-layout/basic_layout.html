            Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints. Birds, at
            over
            10,700 living species, are among the most diverse group of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence,
            paleontologists
            have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs.
            Dinosaurs
            are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half
            of
            the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed
            dinosaurs
            to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that
            dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction.
            Some
            were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying, and that
            nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.

        <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.</p>

            They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact
            origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.
        </p>

        <p>
            They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic Jurassic extinction event 201 million
            years
            ago; their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Reverse genetic engineering and
            the
            fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier
            theropods
            during the late Jurassic Period.
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 66
            million
            years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which
            are
            all dinosaurs other than birds. This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

            Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur
            skeletons
            have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world
            culture.
        </p>

        <p>
            The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have
            ensured
            dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.
        </p>

        <p>
            Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and
            new
            discoveries are regularly covered by the media.
