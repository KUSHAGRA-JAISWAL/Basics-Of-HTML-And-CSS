                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
                        content.
                        For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points,
                        or
                        using images and data tables.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>The main reason why HTML and CSS aren't considered programming languages is because they only
                        determine the structure and the style of the webpage you're building. They don't contain any
                        instructions like the other front-end languages.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- column 3 -->
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
                    <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that we can use to create a row or a column axis
                        layout.
                        It makes our life easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use tricky
                        hacks
                        and a lot of float and position properties in our CSS code.</p>
